final project 'Coordinate Plotting Table' guide:

    how to format coordinates correctly:
There is both an x and y edit boxes, which can cause you problems if you do not format them correctly. 
From the list of the coordinates you wish to plot, you need to put your x's in the same position as your
y's. In each of these boxes, each of the x or y variables need to be separated by a space or a comma.
for example if you wanted to plot (a,b) and (c,d), in the x edit box you would input "a c" or "a,c"
and in the y edit box you would put "b d" or "b,d". If you were to use c first instead of a, you will
need to modify your y variable order to match. If you put three x inputs and two y inputs and error 
message will pop up saying what variable is missing. I do not have anything for if you put anything other
than numbers in these boxes, but just know to only put numbers in. 

How to use the limits correctly:
The X and Y limit boxes change the scale of the specified axis in order to correctly display all data points.
These can be left blank and will change along with your inputs, but it is better to make the limits a little
larger than your largest values and smaller than your smallest values. The X limits can be used independently 
from the y limits (as in if you only want to change one axis on the plot). If the lower limit is greater than 
or equal to your higher limit, then an error message will pop up to specify the error. If one of the x limits
has a value and the other is empty, then an error message will adress this (same for y).

labeling the x axis, y axis, and plot title:
You are not required to put anything for the three things mentioned above, but when working with measured data
you might need to label your units. To do this simply just input your desired unit or label in the correct x or y
axis label. The plot title works the exact same way. 

Plotting:
Once you believe you have all of your correct inputs in the correct edit boxes and formatted correctly, you can hit 
the plot button. The buttons to select the color and style of your points can be chosen before, or edited live on the
graph. If you wish to change your x and y limits, those can be typed in again and hit plot again to view the changed 
graph. There should be error messages for everything other than if you put letters in the x and y edit boxes.
